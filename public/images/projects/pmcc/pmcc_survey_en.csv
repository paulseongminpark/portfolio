Just meeting these people feels like preparing for my second life (because I'm very curious about and looking forward to the members' futures).","The very fact that we created a community by naming a pure gathering that wasn't for profit, to learn something, or to get help.

Whether to do some business together through connection, create programs to connect members, or create your own brand through advertising revenue and profits, etc.","I think inspiration isn't only necessary for people who do art. Inspiration is always needed for the direction of our lives, but I think it can't be received just because someone intends it, so I want to give many opportunities to receive inspiration.",5,Just as an idea... how about creating several more routes to run in various places and go to new places after that?,,

I'm so lacking that I think I'll have to work hard to match up with those people.,"I think it's enough distance to feel each other's breathing when running together and matching rhythms. The moment when out-of-breath exhalations mix with mine, the worried sighs when facing uphill, the relieved sighs when facing downhill. The harmony of these carbon dioxides...

I should try writing a diary every day. When meeting someone with a different attitude from me, the enlightenment and self-reflection gained at that moment often disappears when the encounter ends, but I want to keep giving myself positive energy by reviewing the points I felt at that moment. As a means to do that, I should write a diary so I can reflect back on that time and learn from my past self even in the distant future. (Stories about discovering current concerns in past diaries, attitude of continuously taking notes of inspiration during conversations) 2. To be satisfied with what I like itself without comparing with others, I need an experience of extreme immersion, which requires effort to focus on what I like. Let's focus on one thing.

(From the story that passion arises from inferiority complex and desire)",4,"The time spent sweating with people together seems to help people who don't know each other get closer. I think the three philosophies are deeply connected, and I think long-term interaction is necessary to achieve the third goal. Each meeting time doesn't need to be long, but if meeting opportunities continue long-term and we can share life problems, concerns, and inspirations during that process, we can achieve genuine connection.","I think people need a group they can rely on. There may be cases when they can't rely on family, so I think the more such groups there are, the better. Individuals belonging to a group with a culture of listening will feel understood and accepted by that group and will be able to rely on that group.

I feel that life is not about living alone, but that we can develop more when we move forward matching steps together.","There are so many values that make life healthy, not just the goal of becoming healthy through exercise, so I think I can confidently introduce it to precious people around me.",5,"For invited members, I give a small opinion that it would be good if hopeful regular members provide drinks, etc. with a small membership fee~",Nature exploration running sessions (nature-friendly activities such as Namsan's hidden rough mountain trails and Bukaksan trail running),,

j2V61a,YVd1B0,2024-09-03 12:29,"First, I was very satisfied with the opportunity to refresh my mind through running. I was proud of myself for running a distance I would have definitely stopped in the middle of if I had run alone. Above all, I hadn't had a chance to empty my mind for the past few months, but I'm satisfied that I ran with truly no thoughts around the halfway point of running. Second, I gained comfort through a sense of homogeneity in the place where we had conversations. There aren't many places where people can have somewhat deep conversations, and I was comforted by the fact that so many people who think similarly at a similar depth gathered like this.","Regarding 'why' we do something, I thought I definitely live with beliefs when I heard that beliefs are emphasized, but as time passes, I feel the need to specify what beliefs I have. I realize I'm in a vague state where I can't express it accurately even though it's an important element that makes up who I am, so I think more deeply about what my beliefs are.",I most resonate with achieving genuine connection. Perhaps the fact that we're creating one connection point by investing one morning to many people living apart in the world feels very valuable.,"Regarding this, I think it really varies by person. When I think of friends around me, there are also many people who pursue only superficial things and think only about their surroundings, so I want to recommend it to people who can truly understand this value.","I was very satisfied with my first participation. Personally, what I'm curious about is: if I continue participating, won't the conversation topics revolve around the attending people?

I also fully resonate with the values that come after, but I'm confident I'll feel them even more strongly after some more time passes while continuing to participate in this community.

I hope many people who know the joy of running together increase.,"I'll improve on what needs improvement while participating more. First, when running together, there were cases where instead of running in two columns, people ran in groups of three, two, or four in a disorderly manner. When that happened, there were definitely people who were left out, people who ran alone, and there's concern it could harm other runners in terms of running manners. It's too good to match up with new people and run while talking after a brief rest in the middle of running, but I hope it happens within the rule of two columns.","Ideation Session where specific topics are pre-selected and discussed in depth, Nature exploration running sessions (nature-friendly activities such as Namsan's hidden rough mountain trails and Bukaksan trail running)",,
